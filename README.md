This is a MongoDB dashboard. To install it, you can clone the project. Make sure you have node.js installed locally, do an npm install, then type node server.js to start the server
It will start the server on port 5001. To view the app, type in http://localhost:5001/#/db to your browser
This is a scaled down version of the MEAN stack meant for quick development and testing,
this version will have no security or 3rd party modules, it's implemented with Angular 1.6
There is also some Cassandra management tools in the home area. In the future I will add the ability to add new database connections and hopfeully make it prettier.
